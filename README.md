# Bouncer-of-the-Year
I made this game using python . In this game there would be a ball and a paddle . The goal of this game is to not let the ball touch the bottom of the game window using the paddle and score points .

Instructions:

To start the game you should click on the window . After that you should use the right and left arrow keys to move the paddle accordingly . Your points are displayed on top of the screen . When the ball touches the paddle it bounces and you get 1 more point . When the ball touches the bottom of the screen everything freezes immediately and a Game Over text is displayed and the game ends
